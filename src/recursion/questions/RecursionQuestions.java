            The order of subsets are not important.

            Problem statement
            Assume that the value of a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ... , z = 26. You are given a numeric string S. Write a program to return the list of all possible codes that can be generated from the given string.
                        
            Note : The order of codes are not important. And input string does not contain 0s.
