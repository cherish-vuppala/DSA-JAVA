            Given an array A of size n and an integer K, return all subsets of A which sum to K.
            Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
            Note :
            The order of subsets are not important.

            1 <= n <= 20
